# React-virtualized table example

## Project Overview

This is a test assessment from Project Discovery which is to evaluate the experience in virtualization/details(e.g. animation) and responsiveness

## Install & Build


```sh
# Node version: v18.14.2

# Install dependencies (there is a version conflict between node and react-virtualized, so use --legacy-peer-deps to ignore it)
npm i --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the application
npm start

# Build the application
npm run build
```
